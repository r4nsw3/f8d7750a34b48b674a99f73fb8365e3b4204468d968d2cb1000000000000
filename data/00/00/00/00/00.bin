  |   Black Future '88 is a Synth-Punk roguelike 2D action Shooter.         |
  |   Vertically climb an always evolving procedural tower to reach the     |
  |   top and kill its insane owner...before your heart explodes. Shoot,    |
  |   slash, dash and upgrade yourself to survive the endless waves of      |
  |   deadly traps, homicidal AI and colossal Wardens standing in your      |
  |   way in a stylish alternative version of 1988.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The world is reeling from a nuclear cataclysm, created by Duncan,     |
  |   the tower architect. The First of his bombs fell in the summer of     |
  |   1988, and by December they had blacked-out the sun with endless       |
  |   rain. We decided to stop keeping time after this, and it's been       |
  |   1988 ever since. Everything that lived through the initial attack     |
  |   will die in the extreme floods that followed. These are the times     |
  |   after, where there are no more months, or even weeks...everything     |
  |   is measured in minutes left to live.                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Take on the mantle of one of the last remaining misfit survivors,     |
  |   and fight your way to the top of the tower to kill the architect      |
  |   and stop the endless nuclear rain. Ascend to die, and die to          |
  |   survive.                                                              |
